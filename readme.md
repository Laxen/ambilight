ESP Choice
* ESP32 is generally cheaper and better than ESP8266 (faster CPU, BLE, more RAM/flash)
* The ESP32-WROOM boards don't expose the USB interface of the ESP32, which would then require an additional USB-to-UART component
* The ESP32-C3-MINI boards expose USB and have really good documentation
